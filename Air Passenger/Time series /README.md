Introduction
Time series analysis helps in understanding historical data trends and making forecasts. This project uses a dataset containing monthly totals of international air passengers from 1949 to 1960.

Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:

Month: Represents the month and year of the record.
Number of Passengers: The count of air passengers in that month.
The data is publicly available and often used in time series forecasting tutorials.

Objectives
Understand the dataset by visualizing trends, seasonality, and noise.
Perform stationarity tests and transform the data if necessary.
Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
Forecast future passenger numbers using:
ARIMA
SARIMA
LSTM or other machine learning techniques.
Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Trend and seasonality visualization.
Rolling statistics for moving averages.
Stationarity Testing:

Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
Time Series Decomposition:

Breaking data into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
Forecasting:

Statistical models: ARIMA, SARIMA.
Machine learning: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
Model Evaluation:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Parse dates, handle missing values, and resample the data if necessary.
EDA:

Plot the time series and analyze its characteristics.
Stationarity Check:

Apply ADF test and visualize rolling statistics.
Modeling:

Fit models to the data and make predictions.
Validation:

Split data into train and test sets and evaluate model performance.
Visualization of Predictions:

Compare actual vs. predicted values.
Requirements
Install the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
statsmodels
scikit-learn
tensorflow (for LSTM)

Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of time series analysis in understanding historical trends and making accurate predictions. By combining traditional statistical methods with machine learning, robust insights were achieved.
