# Iris flower classification project

This is an Iris flower classification project.  The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and 
each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict 
flowers based on their specific features. <br>

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):  <br>
Length of the sepals  <br>
Width of the sepals  <br>
Length of the petals  <br>
Width of the petals  <br>
